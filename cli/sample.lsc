    <title> The document title </title>

    <section>

        <heading> A heading </heading>

        This is a simple paragraph with some **Markdown** to spice things up!

        # Another heading in Markdown format

        Another paragraph in **Markdown** format.
        And this is a line in the paragraph.

        Kind of like this line belongs
        to the next paragraph.
